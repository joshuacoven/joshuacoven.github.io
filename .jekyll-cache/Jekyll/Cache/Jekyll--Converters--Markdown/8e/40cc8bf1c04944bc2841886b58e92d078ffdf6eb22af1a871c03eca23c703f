            Urban Flight Seeded the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Arpit Gupta and Iris Yao</h4>
        <p>We document large-scale urban flight in the United States in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic. Populations that flee are disproportionately younger, whiter, and wealthier. Regions that saw migrant influx experience greater subsequent COVID-19 case
growth, suggesting that urban flight was a vector of disease spread. Urban residents
fled to socially connected areas, consistent with the notion that individuals were sheltering with friends and family or in second homes. The association of migration and
subsequent case growth persists when instrumenting for migration with social networks, pointing to a causal association.</p>

            Racial Disparities in Frontline Workers and Housing Crowding During COVID-19: Evidence from Geolocation Data
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Milena Almagro, Arpit Gupta, and Angelo Orane-Hutchinson</h4>
       <p>We document that racial disparities in COVID-19 in New York City stem from patterns of commuting and housing crowding. During the initial wave of the pandemic,
we find that out-of-home activity related to commuting is strongly associated with
COVID-19 cases at the ZIP Code level and hospitalization at an individual level. After layoffs of essential workers decreased commuting, we find case growth continued
through household crowding. A larger share of individuals in crowded housing or
commuting to essential work are Black, Hispanic, and lower-income. As a result,
structural inequalities, rather than population density, play a role in determining the
cross-section of COVID-19 risk exposure in urban areas.</p>

            Disparities in Mobility Responses to COVID-19
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Arpit Gupta</h4>
        <p>We investigate the role of demographic differences in mobility in explaining disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in New York City. We find: 1) New York City residents
in richer neighborhoods are substantially more likely to flee the city, 2) Low-income,
black, and Hispanic neighborhoods exhibit more work activity during the day, and
3) these neighborhoods also exhibit less sheltering in place activity during non-work
hours. Measured disparities in COVID-19 cases are attenuated after accounting for
these mobility responses. Our results point to important inequities in access to sheltering options during pandemics within cities.</p>
