            Urban Flight Seeded the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Arpit Gupta and Iris Yao</h4>
        <h5>Forthcoming, Journal of Urban Economics: Insights</h5>
        <p>We document large-scale urban flight in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regions that saw migrant influx experienced greater subsequent new COVID-19 cases, linking urban flight (as a disease vector) and coronavirus spread in destination areas. Urban residents fled to socially connected areas, consistent with the theory that individuals sheltered with friends and family, or in second homes. Populations that fled were disproportionately younger, whiter, and wealthier. The association between migration and subsequent new cases persists when instrumenting for migration with social networks.</p>

            Disparities in COVID-19 Risk Exposure: Evidence from Geolocation Data
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Milena Almagro, Arpit Gupta, and Angelo Orane-Hutchinson</h4>
       <p>We examine the determinants of COVID-19 risk exposure in the context of the initial
wave in New York City. During the beginning of the first wave of the pandemic, outof-home activity related to commuting was strongly associated with COVID-19 cases
at the ZIP code level and hospitalization at an individual level. After layoffs of workers decreased commuting, case growth continued through household crowding. A
larger share of individuals in crowded housing, or commuting to essential and frontline work, are Black, Hispanic, and lower-income—which contributes to disparities in
disease risk. As a result, our paper shows that structural socio-economic inequalities
help determine the cross-section of COVID-19 risk exposure in urban areas.</p>

            Disparities in Mobility Responses to COVID-19
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Arpit Gupta</h4>
        <p>We investigate the role of demographic differences in mobility in explaining disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in New York City. We find: 1) New York City residents
in richer neighborhoods are substantially more likely to flee the city, 2) Low-income,
black, and Hispanic neighborhoods exhibit more work activity during the day, and
3) these neighborhoods also exhibit less sheltering in place activity during non-work
hours. Measured disparities in COVID-19 cases are attenuated after accounting for
these mobility responses. Our results point to important inequities in access to sheltering options during pandemics within cities.</p>
