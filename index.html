            Urban Flight Seeded the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Arpit Gupta and Iris Yao</h4>
        <p>We document large-scale urban flight in the United States in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic. Populations that flee are disproportionately younger, whiter, and wealthier. Regions that saw migrant influx experience greater subsequent COVID-19 case
            growth, suggesting that urban flight was a vector of disease spread. </p>

            Racial Disparities in Frontline Workers and Housing Crowding During COVID-19: Evidence from Geolocation Data
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Milena Almagro, Arpit Gupta, and Angelo Orane-Hutchinson</h4>
       <p>We document that racial disparities in COVID-19 in New York City stem from patterns of commuting and housing crowding. A larger share of individuals in crowded housing or
        commuting to essential work are Black, Hispanic, and lower-income. As a result,
        structural inequalities, rather than population density, play a role in determining the
        cross-section of COVID-19 risk exposure in urban areas.</p>

            Disparities in Mobility Responses to COVID-19
            </a>
        </h3>
        <h4>with Arpit Gupta</h4>
        <p>We investigate the role of demographic differences in mobility in explaining disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in New York City. We find: 1) New York City residents
            in richer neighborhoods are substantially more likely to flee the city, 2) Low-income,
            black, and Hispanic neighborhoods exhibit more work activity during the day, and
            3) these neighborhoods also exhibit less sheltering in place activity during non-work
            hours.</p>
